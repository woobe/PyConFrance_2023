## Supercharging Jupyter notebooks for effective storytelling

Jupyter notebook is a popular tool for data analysis, but once the analysis is complete, it can be challenging to share the insights in a presentable and accessible way.

In this talk, I will show you some practical steps to organise and present your results in a friendly way to your viewers. I will also demonstrate how to turn a Jupyter notebook (or just the selected cells in a notebook) into an interactive web app with a few lines of code.

All examples will be based on typical data analyses with open-source packages such as Datapane. You will walk away from this session with tips and code snippets to improve your own Jupyter notebooks straight away.
